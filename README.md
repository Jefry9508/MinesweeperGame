## Project compilation  

In order to run the project from the console you must have Java 8 installed on your computer. Then you must open a terminal and locate yourself at the project location.

Now you must go to the src folder by running the command:

```console
cd src/
```

To be able to execute the project, you must compile its source code by typing the command:

```console
javac com\psl\logic\Game.java com\psl\logic\Board.java com\psl\logic\ICell.java com\psl\logic\Mine.java com\psl\logic\Square.java com\psl\exceptions\WrongEntryException.java
```

And to run it, you run the command:

```console
java -cp . com.psl.logic.Game
```
